## User Story: 
AS A 
 Crypto investor I want a website with polished UI that can retreive crypto prices and recent news and add my favorite crypto to a watch list

SO THAT I can make informed investing decisions when updating my portfolio and have a list of my favorite cryptos for easy access.

GIVEN THAT I want to consider a crypto currency 

WHEN I search for a crypto 

THEN I am presented with the crypto's price, logo, and recent news surrounding that currency

WHEN I like the crypto I searched for, I can add it to a new watchlist or I can add it to an existing one

THEN I can view my watchlist with live prices next to the crypto name for each currency in that list
